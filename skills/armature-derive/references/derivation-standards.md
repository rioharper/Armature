# Derivation Notes — Standards

The target register: a sharp senior engineer's design notebook — the findings they'd actually leave for later-you to pick the project back up from, the story of what they expected, what they tried, and what the numbers said, told alongside the hard math. Not a journal paper. No result gets skipped, but nothing gets padded to look thorough either. If a sentence doesn't carry information later-you would need, cut it.

## File layout

Each project's derivation is four files, not one — the layout and per-milestone content live in SKILL.md. Every file:

- opens with a one-line header: project name, milestone, rev/date, and which module or package accompanies it
- ends with a short revision note: what changed since the last rev and why — this is what makes re-derivations traceable
- stays one continuous argument. The module splits along the note's sections; the note itself never splits, and carries no size gate — `layout.py` reports its length for information only

## Writing rules

1. **Prose carries the argument; equations punctuate it.** Every equation gets a sentence saying what we're about to do and *why*; a significant result gets one sentence of physical interpretation after it. Bullets are for the parameter table and checklists only — not for the derivation steps themselves.
2. **Number every displayed equation** (1), (2), … and refer back by number.
3. **No skipped leaps, but compression is fine.** "Expanding and collecting q̇₁q̇₂ terms" is fine; a step that can't be named is a step that got skipped. If SymPy did an ugly simplification, say so briefly rather than presenting the tidy output as if you did it by hand.
4. **Notation discipline.** Define every symbol at first use, use it consistently, match the project's symbol table exactly. State the rotation/frame convention once and don't restate it every section.
5. **Units on every number.** A number without a unit is a typo.
6. **Interpret, don't just derive — but in one sentence, not a paragraph.** After the Jacobian: which postures are singular, and would this robot ever be near them? After gravity terms: which joint carries the worst static load? The one exception to lean is `03_results.md`: findings get the room they need (SKILL.md's Milestone 3 defines what they must contain).
7. **Honest uncertainty, briefly flagged.** An assumption that materially affects results (ignoring friction in a high-reduction gearbox) gets one flag with the expected direction and rough size of the error — in `03_results.md`, not scattered as hedges throughout.
8. **Sanity checks are shown, not claimed.** "Setting l₂ → 0 reduces (12) to the single-pendulum result (13)" — with (13) actually shown. One line is enough: "verified" without the verification fails one way, three sentences of narration around a one-line check fails the other.
9. **No filler, no restating.** Ban: "It is important to note", "In the world of robotics", "delve", "plays a crucial role", restating the section header as the first sentence, and summary paragraphs that repeat what the section just said. If cutting a sentence loses no information, cut it.
10. **LaTeX in markdown** ($...$, $$...$$). **A long symbolic result is printed, never pasted.** Present its structure ("M₁₂ has the form a + b cos q₂ where a = …") and cite the report module that prints the full expression. A result longer than a line of the note is the report module's to carry.
11. **Say what you expected before you computed it.** Every significant result carries the prediction made before the numbers ran — a hand estimate, a limiting case, a hunch with its reason — and whether the result confirmed or surprised it. A confirmed result and a surprising one read differently, and later-you needs to know which this was.
12. **An abandoned approach gets one sentence on why it died.** "Newton-Euler first; dropped because the reaction forces weren't needed and the recursion hid the structure of M." Later-you doesn't re-walk a path already ruled out.

## Which layer a sentence lives in

A note and its module each carry what the other cannot, and a sentence said in both is paid for on every read of the module. Narrative, derivation, physical argument, and revision history — the story of a correction included — live in the note. The module carries the computation and the least prose a caller needs:

- **Function docstring**: one sentence of what the function computes; the note's equation or section it implements; and anything a *caller* needs that the note does not say — units, sign conventions, failure modes, why a default is what it is.
- **Module docstring**: orientation in about ten lines — the note and sections it mirrors, where its checks live, what it imports — pointing at the note for the argument.

A derivation, a justification of the physics, or the history of a fix belongs in the note, with the docstring citing it. The test for any sentence in a docstring: would it be wrong to say this in the note? If not, it belongs in the note.

## Length is a signal, not a target

This governs the notes; the modules are held to a hard budget instead (the plugin's `references/model-layout.md`). A milestone file that's short because the mechanism is simple is correct. A milestone file that's long because every step is doing real work is also correct. A milestone file that's long because of hedging, restated interpretation, or an equation shown three ways when one would do is the failure mode to catch on re-read — trim it before moving to the next milestone, not at the end when trimming means re-touching four files instead of one.

## References

Cite the convention source (e.g., Craig for mDH, Lynch & Park for PoE) and anything nonstandard, once, in `00_setup.md`. No fake citations — a result from your own derivation needs none.

## Design data from a book

Numbers a design leans on that no vendor publishes — fatigue endurance points, finite-life tables, friction pairs, form factors — have no `docs/datasheets/index.md` row for the librarian to cache, so "cite index rows, never memory" gives them their own rule:

- **Tag it `standard`** in `params.py` and name the book, edition, and the table, figure, or section the number sits in — "Zimmerli's data as Shigley reports it, §10-7"; "Associated Spring finite-life table, Norton Table 14-7". A book named without its table is memory.
- **Find a second independent source and carry both.** Textbook design data is somebody's fit to somebody's tests, and two fits disagree: shot-peened spring wire endurance points differ by 30 % between two standard sources that agree within 6 % unpeened, which is the whole fatigue margin of a peened coil. Read the result against each source, state both, and design to the conservative one.
- **Pin the disagreement with a self-test**, so a later edit cannot quietly swap which source the design leans on.
- **Ask the vendor for its own basis.** A vendor held to the number rates its part against data of its own; that question goes on the questionnaire or the part's specification (`armature-spec`), and its answer supersedes both books.
