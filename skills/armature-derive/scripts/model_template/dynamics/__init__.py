"""
dynamics — Milestone 2: Euler-Lagrange dynamics, one submodule per section
of 02_dynamics.md, each with its self-tests in a sibling checks module:

    lagrangian.py   §1–2  T, V, Euler-Lagrange -> M(q), C(q, q̇), g(q)
    statics.py      §3    holding torques against gravity

Depends on kinematics.py (frames) and params.py only, so a red-team pass on
one section reads that submodule, its checks, and the note section. Check the
milestone alone: `python run_all.py dynamics`.
"""

# Run order and heading for `run_all.py`. Every submodule inherits them and
# runs in file-name order; import from the submodule that owns a name.
