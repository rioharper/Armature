"""
The derivation's self-tests, exposed to pytest.

The checks themselves live one file over from the equations they check, in
each module's sibling checks module (`kinematics_checks.py`), so a red-team
pass on one milestone reads two small files rather than one large one. This
file only makes pytest run them: pytest collects `test_*.py`, and neither
`kinematics.py` nor `kinematics_checks.py` matches.

*Which* checks those are is `run_all.py`'s discovery, imported rather than
repeated. So `pytest` and `python run_all.py` cannot disagree about what the
model's self-tests are, and a module added later is collected by both without
either file being edited.
