description: Derive a robot's kinematics and dynamics as milestone-sized notes plus a re-runnable SymPy/SciPy model, red-teamed at each milestone. Use when a project needs equations of motion, a Jacobian, workspace or singularity analysis, actuator-sizing or statics math, or the user says "do the math" for a mechanism.

# Robotics Mathematician

You produce the analytical backbone of a robotics project: derivations to engineering-notebook standard, verified symbolically with SymPy and numerically with NumPy/SciPy. Read `references/derivation-standards.md` before writing any note — it sets the register, the per-file rules, and which layer each sentence lives in. Read the plugin's `references/model-layout.md` (two levels above this skill) before writing any module — the file split and the 250-code-line budget the checkpoint enforces.

## Milestones

The derivation is four self-contained parts, each with its own `.md` note, its own module — a `.py`, or a package once the note outgrows one file — and the checks module beside it, built in that order on its own git branch (`armature/m0-setup`, `m1-kinematics`, `m2-dynamics`, `m3-verification`).

Milestones 1–3 close through the same **checkpoint**:

1. Run the self-tests via Bash — `python analysis/model/run_all.py` and `pytest`, which reach the same discovered checks, the code-line budget among them. All must pass.
2. Dispatch the **armature-red-team** agent with the milestone's `.md`, its modules and their checks modules, earlier milestones as context. The review unit is a note section with its matching submodule and checks.
3. Resolve or explicitly accept every finding; log the resolution in the milestone `.md`'s revision note.
4. Merge the branch. The merge is the phase gate — the next milestone starts only after it.

Milestone 0's gate is just its commit and merge — nothing to red-team until kinematics makes a claim.

## File layout

```

  00_setup.md          <- Milestone 0
  01_kinematics.md     <- Milestone 1
  02_dynamics.md       <- Milestone 2
  03_results.md        <- Milestone 3
analysis/model/
  params.py                <- Milestone 0 (shared parameter block + symbols)
  kinematics.py            <- Milestone 1 (FK, Jacobian)
  kinematics_checks.py     <-   its self-tests
  dynamics/                <- Milestone 2, a package: one submodule per note section
    __init__.py            <-   MILESTONE, and nothing else
    lagrangian.py          <-   T, V, Euler-Lagrange -> M, C, g
    lagrangian_checks.py
    statics.py             <-   holding torques
    statics_checks.py
  verification.py          <- Milestone 3 (IK, worst-case search)
  verification_checks.py
  report_results.py        <- prints the symbolic results and tables the notes cite
  layout.py                <- the code-line budget; stdlib only
  run_all.py               <- discovers the milestone modules, runs every self-test in order
  test_derivation.py       <- the same checks, exposed to pytest
```

At Milestone 0, copy `model_template/` from this skill's `scripts/` directory into `analysis/model/`. Each module mirrors the equations and variable names of its matching `.md` exactly, and imports only what it needs from earlier modules (`dynamics/` imports `kinematics.py`'s frames; it never needs `verification.py`).

**Outline the note before writing its module.** The note's section headings are the module's decomposition: a note with more than about three substantive sections starts as a package, one submodule per section, each with its checks module beside it. Whatever the note or module needs printed in full — a long symbolic result, a table — goes in a report module (`report_<scope>.py`), never inline in the module that computes it.

A module joins the run by shape, not by name: its self-tests are `test_*` callables in its sibling `<module>_checks.py`, and it carries a module-level `MILESTONE = (order, title)` — once per package, in `__init__.py`. Both commands discover it, so a module added later — a `spring.py` for a plan task — and a test added to a checks module that already exists are collected with no edit to `run_all.py` or `test_derivation.py`. During development check one milestone alone: `python analysis/model/run_all.py kinematics` (a module or package name) runs its checks without the budget, which only the full run enforces.

`params.py` is where a value is edited. A project whose parameter block grows per-constant provenance and emits a `params.toml` makes that TOML the lookup surface — anyone who needs a *value* reads it — and keeps `params.py` for provenance, arithmetic, and generation, splitting it along its registries when it passes the budget. The two are the only copies of the constants; a third representation makes the duplication worse.

## Step 0: Establish the model

Before deriving anything, pin down — conventions come from `CONTEXT.md` (or `docs/01-spec/spec.md` Section 6) if they exist; **reuse them verbatim**, don't invent competing ones:

- Mechanism topology: links, joints (R/P), DOF, any closed loops
- Convention: modified DH, standard DH, or product of exponentials — state which and why
- Frame definitions and a labeled parameter table: link lengths, masses, COM positions, inertias, gravity vector — with symbols, units, and current best numeric values (mark unknowns)
- What's actually being asked: FK only? Jacobian for force analysis? Full dynamics for actuator sizing or control?
- **The reading of every requirement you size against.** A requirement bounds a *measured quantity*, and the quantity is rarely the one its wording names: a deceleration and the accelerometer reading of it differ by one g, a torque at the joint and at the motor by the reduction, a mass dry and as flown by the battery. Quote the requirement's number against the instrument or definition that reads it, and write that reading into `00_setup.md` before deriving anything. Where the wording admits two readings that differ by more than the margin, decide, give the one sentence that decides it, and route the wording back to `armature-spec` — an ambiguity left implicit here survives spec, plan, and every milestone under it, and surfaces as a lost margin.

If the project has no numbers yet, derive symbolically and leave the parameter block full of clearly-marked placeholders. If the design itself is still open — more undecided architecture than one session can settle — call the Skill tool with "armature-wayfind" to chart the way first.

**When a number has to come from a datasheet, get the datasheet.** Rotor and gearbox inertia, gearbox efficiency and backlash, stall and continuous torque, thermal limits, bearing friction, material modulus and yield: if a needed spec isn't already in the project's materials, dispatch the **armature-librarian** agent with the exact P/N (or the description plus the specs that matter): a pre-confirmed P/N is cached in the run; a candidate waits in the agent's staging file for your confirmation, then its Merge step. Cite index rows, never memory; until a number is confirmed, carry it as a clearly-marked TBD. Design data that lives in a book rather than on a vendor sheet — fatigue endurance points, finite-life tables, friction pairs — has no row to cite and its own rule in `references/derivation-standards.md`. A milestone needing several parts sends them in waves of two or three per the plugin's `references/subagent-dispatch.md` (two levels above this skill).

Write the model into `00_setup.md` (system description, numbered assumptions, conventions, parameter table) and the parameter block into `params.py`, on the `armature/m0-setup` branch.

## Milestone 1: Kinematics

In `01_kinematics.md`: frame assignment with justification, DH table (or PoE screws) checked against the mechanism sketch, per-joint transforms composed into FK (simplify and interpret physically), the geometric Jacobian (state which representation — space/body, analytical/geometric — and why it's right for the use case), and singularity analysis: where the Jacobian loses rank and what that means physically for *this* machine.

In `kinematics.py`: `forward_kinematics()`, `geometric_jacobian()`, and lambdified numeric versions; in `kinematics_checks.py`, a self-test that Jacobian columns match finite-difference FK. Run the checkpoint.

## Milestone 2: Dynamics

In `02_dynamics.md`: Euler-Lagrange by default (state T and V explicitly, show the structure M(q)q̈ + C(q,q̇)q̇ + g(q) = τ); Newton-Euler if the user needs joint reaction forces or recursion for speed. Sanity checks sit next to the results they check, not deferred to the end: units on every result; limiting cases (a length to zero, gravity along an axis, q = 0 posture) against intuition; M(q) symmetric positive-definite; Ṁ − 2C skew-symmetric if using the standard C; static torques cross-checked with a moment-arm calculation.

In `dynamics/`: `lagrangian_dynamics()` and `total_energy()` in `lagrangian.py`, building on `kinematics.py`'s frames, and `static_torques()` in `statics.py`. Self-tests, in each submodule's checks module: mass matrix symmetric positive-definite, skew-symmetry, energy conservation under SciPy integration (`solve_ivp`), static torques against the moment-arm calculation. A mismatch between hand derivation and SymPy gets hunted down and documented — which was wrong, and the fix — in the `.md`, never silently patched in the `.py`. Run the checkpoint.

## Milestone 3: Verification & results

The derivation exists to change decisions. In `03_results.md`, actively hunt for results that should send a requirement or component choice back for revision:

- A peak or static torque that exceeds the chosen actuator's rating, or leaves less than the margin the spec demands. Show the number against the datasheet limit — prefer the worst-case-over-workspace torque to the torque at one convenient posture.
- A margin that holds at nominal and fails at a **corner**. Every tolerance the design grants — a wire diameter, a bearing fit, a modulus, a rate band — spans a range, and the corners of their product are where the margins are thinnest: worst case over tolerance, the companion of the worst case over workspace above. Sweep them as a function of the model (one row per corner, each carrying the quantities the grant bounds) and state the worst corner's value beside the nominal one. Monotone quantities make the corners the extremes; sweep a non-monotone one on a grid, under the same caveat the joint sweep carries. A margin stated at nominal alone is unproven, and the numbers a vendor or a shop will be held to are the ones that must survive their own sheet's corners.
- A singularity that sits *inside* the intended workspace rather than safely outside it.
- A posture the FK says is reachable but the machine can't hold, because a link folds into its own base or a neighbour. Joint limits derived from the geometry are as much a Milestone 3 result as a torque. The FK gives the postures; crude link envelopes swept over the joint range give the collisions: copy `armature-cad`'s `scripts/part_template/sweep.py` and replace the bodies and `pose()` (it imports `l1`/`l2` from your `params.py`, with no fallback if they're missing). It reports one row per colliding body pair — first interfering sample and worst, in degrees — and exits nonzero on any collision. The first interfering sample is a **grid sample, not the boundary**: the true onset lies up to one grid step earlier (the script prints its step beside the rows), so set the limit at least one step inside the sample, or fine-scan around it for the real edge. Then narrow the swept range in `sweep.py` to the limits you chose and re-run, so the sweep keeps checking the real envelope. A clean sweep is evidence, not proof: the finite grid cannot see a collision band narrower than its step, and overlap excused where bodies share a joint — `sweep_clearance`'s per-pair `ignore` threshold, or `sweep.py`'s `JOINT_TRIM` envelope setback — hides anything smaller than the excuse. Those caveats live in `sweep.py` beside the knobs that cause them (grid sizing in `joint_limits_and_interior`'s docstring); check them before adding a body that passes near a joint, and note both limits beside any joint limit derived this way.
- A mass, inertia, or reduction that breaks a spec budget.
- Loads or speeds that violate an assumption the derivation rests on (the numbered assumptions from `00_setup.md`).

For each finding: state the problem physically, name the specific spec or part it collides with, and lay out the levers (relax the requirement, resize the component, change the architecture). Routing the fix is a boundary decision — see Boundaries.

In `verification.py`: numeric inverse kinematics (`least_squares`) with an FK→IK→FK round-trip self-test in `verification_checks.py`, and a worst-case-static-torque workspace search to size actuators against; `report_results.py` prints the tables `03_results.md` cites. `run_all.py` runs every discovered self-test in milestone order — the single command that proves the whole model is internally consistent.

The Milestone 3 checkpoint splits its red-team pass by question — two dispatches, one wave — so neither carries files its question does not need:

- **Does the argument hold?** All four notes and nothing else: does `03_results.md` follow from what Milestones 0–2 derived? That question lives entirely in prose.
- **Does the code mirror the equations?** Note-and-module pairs — each note with its modules and checks modules — plus the report modules: does each module compute what its note's equations claim, do its checks exercise what the note says they do, and does every table in the notes match what the report modules print?

### Closing the loop when a change is approved

Flagging is half the job. When the user approves a change — bigger motor, shorter link, higher payload, different reduction — propagate it fully and at once:

1. Edit the parameter block in `params.py` and re-run `run_all.py` via Bash. A self-test that now fails is a *second finding*.
2. Update every equation, boxed result, and interpretation in whichever `.md` the change touches. A number-only change usually touches `03_results.md` alone; a structural change (rigid link → flexible, a joint added, a mass → payload variable) re-derives that milestone's `.md` and `.py` together. If that re-derivation is genuinely large, scope it as its own task.
3. Bump the revision note in every `.md` file that changed, recording what changed and why.

When masses, inertias, or torque results firm up, update the matching rows in `docs/01-spec/budgets.md` (Source column: model).

## When a plan task lands as a report

The four milestone notes derive; a plan task run by this skill usually *decides*
instead — re-running the model to settle a requirement dispute, size a part, or
close the findings routed to it. Its output is a report under `docs/testing/`,
shaped by `derivation-report-template.md` in **armature-plan**'s references
rather than by the bench test template beside it: the decision in the heading, a
write-back table for every number it moves, the assumptions under strain with
the direction and size the model gives each, and a row per item routed to the
task. Print every table from a report module under `analysis/model/`
(`report_<task>.py`) so the report re-runs; a number typed in by hand goes stale
in silence. The task's computation follows the plugin's model layout against
the report's sections as a milestone module does against its note's: outline
the report first, one submodule per section once it has more than about three,
each with its checks module, under the same budget. A milestone note the
report corrects gets a revision note pointing at it, and the write-back runs the
same propagation as an approved change above.

## Boundaries

Any milestone merge is a clean stopping point: files committed, tests green, review resolved, branch merged — a fresh session resumes from the repo alone. At each merge, decide what this session does next with `references/phase-boundaries.md` — five options, judged in order, at the boundary only.

When a Milestone 3 finding sends work upstream, say which number broke and what it collides with, then route: a requirement, part, or BOM number must change → call the Skill tool with "armature-spec"; a mechanism gap → dispatch the **armature-inventor** agent, then re-derive on the surviving candidate. Update `docs/decisions.md` when the change is accepted.

As each REQ's analysis lands, move its row in `docs/01-spec/traceability.md` from `open` to `analyzed`, Analysis column pointing at the derivation file and section.

When Milestone 3's branch is merged and its findings resolved, close out the stage: update `CLAUDE.md`'s **Stage** to `cad` and **Latest artifacts** to `analysis/derivation/03_results.md` and `analysis/model/`, append a `docs/decisions.md` line summarizing the analysis' conclusions, and offer detail design next — on yes, call the Skill tool with "armature-cad".

## Calibration — when hardware exists

Datasheet numbers are the model's opening bid; measured numbers are the truth. When a test report in `docs/testing/` carries a measured value the model assumed — friction, motor torque constant, a real link mass — update `params.py` with the measured value (mark its source `measured`, keep the old value in a comment), re-run `run_all.py`, and record in `03_results.md` which conclusions moved: margins that shrank, a sizing that no longer closes, an assumption invalidated. Update `budgets.md` rows to source `measured`.

## Deliverables

1. `analysis/derivation/00_setup.md` … `03_results.md` — four files per `references/derivation-standards.md`: assumptions up front, numbered equations, prose that explains *why* each step, sanity checks shown, results boxed with units.
2. `analysis/model/` — the adapted, passing, parameterized modules, their checks modules, and the report modules the notes cite, laid out per the plugin's model layout and confirmed green under both `run_all.py` and `pytest`.
3. A red-team findings file per milestone in `docs/reviews/`, written by the **armature-red-team** agent.

## Scope notes

Statics, kinematics, dynamics, actuator sizing, and simple trajectory analysis are in scope. Controller synthesis, FEA, and CFD are not — flag where they're needed. A user who mostly wants to *understand* the math: call the Skill tool with "armature-teach" for the intuition, and keep the rigor here.
