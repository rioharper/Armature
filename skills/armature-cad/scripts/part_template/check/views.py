    """Write orthographic SVG views with hidden lines, for the part
    definition's "At a glance" section.

    A crude picture orients a modeler faster than a paragraph, and this one
    is not crude — it is the real projected geometry, so it cannot drift
    from the recipe the way a hand-drawn ASCII sketch does.

    The views are exported at scale 1: the SVG declares millimetres and
    they are the projection's own millimetres, and every view in the set
    shares that one scale. Do not normalize each view to a fixed size —
    the obvious thing — because that rescales each view independently by
    its own extent, which draws the same 6 mm plate at 7.50 mm in the
    front view and 8.00 mm in the right one while still declaring Unit.MM.

    MEASURE OFF front/top/right ONLY. Those three are true 1:1 against the
    PART, because each looks down a principal axis, so a feature measured
    off the page is the part's real millimetres (views_checks.py checks
    exactly that, on a shared dimension across two views). The 'iso' view
    is 1:1 only in its own projection plane: an isometric projection
    foreshortens every 3D length, so a number scaled off it is wrong even
    though the SVG says mm just as confidently. The iso is for orientation.

    The camera is aimed at the bounding-box centre, not at the origin.
    `project_to_viewport` defaults `look_at` to the shape's centre, so a
    camera parked on a bare axis direction views an off-origin part along a
    slightly TILTED axis and the projection is no longer 1:1 in either
    direction: a 16 mm-tall part measured 16.67 mm in its front view.

    Returns the paths written.
