    Args:
        part: any build123d shape with volume.
        density: kg/m^3 of the chosen stock (Al 6061 = 2700, PLA = 1240,
            steel = 7850). From the BOM, not from memory.
        about: optional (x, y, z) point IN MM to report inertia about.
            Default None = about the part's own centre of mass.
            The dynamics may have used a joint origin instead — if so,
            pass it, because comparing a COM tensor against a
            joint-origin tensor is a comparison of two unrelated numbers.

    Returns dict with mass [kg], com [m, 3-tuple], inertia [kg m^2, 3x3],
    and `about` naming which point the tensor is taken about: None for the
    part's own COM, else the (x, y, z) tuple in mm. It is stored as a TUPLE,
    not as a formatted label, so `compare_to_target` compares it
    structurally — as a string, a target written (50, 0, 0) reads
    'point (50, 0, 0) mm' against this module's 'point (50.0, 0, 0) mm' and
    false-fails on the rendering of a number rather than on the number.
    `report()` renders the label at print time instead.

    `target` uses the same keys and units as `mass_properties` returns, and

    give it {"mass": ...} alone rather than inventing a tensor for it.

        truncates, so a 1-tuple checks x and silently skips y and z;
