run_all.py — every self-test in cad/parts/, in order, end to end.

    uv run --with 'build123d~=0.11' --with sympy python cad/parts/run_all.py

Exits nonzero on the first failing check, which is what makes it a
pre-commit hook or CI step. `--with sympy` is for analysis/model/params.py,
which the part files and the sweep import.

Discovery is by shape, not by name. A module in this directory, or one level
down in a package, is collected when its sibling checks module
(`part.py` -> `part_checks.py`, `check/mass.py` -> `check/mass_checks.py`)
defines callables named `test_*`; each of those callables is one check.
Nothing in this file lists modules or tests, so a part file added later is
collected the moment its `<PART-ID>_checks.py` lands.

During development run one module or package by name:

    python cad/parts/run_all.py check

It runs that name's checks without the code-line budget in `layout.py`,
which only the full run enforces. The same file ships in armature-derive's
model template, where the modules it collects are milestones.
