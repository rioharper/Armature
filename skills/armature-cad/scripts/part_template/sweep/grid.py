    """Postures to check. Sample the interior, but ALWAYS include the
    limits — interference lives at the extremes, and a grid that stops
    one step short of them reports a clean sweep for a mechanism that
    collides on its first move to a hard stop.

    n=37 (a 10 deg step over the full +-180 deg range) is sized to the
    worked example's own narrowest known collision band, not a round
    number picked by feel. base<->link2's collision band near the folded
    limit is 11 deg wide at 1 deg resolution (last clear at q2=168 deg,
    first interfering at q2=169 deg - re-measured in grid_checks.py).
    A finer, 0.1 deg scan finds the true continuous edge at q2=168.3 deg,
    so 11 deg is itself a slight overstatement of how much margin there
    really is. A grid can only be GUARANTEED to land a sample inside a
    band if its step is smaller than the band - otherwise the band sits
    entirely between two grid points and vanishes, unless it happens to
    abut a sampled endpoint. 10 deg is below the measured 11 deg, so THIS
    worked example's band cannot be stepped over. It promises nothing
    about a band narrower than 10 deg in a mechanism with different
    geometry - remeasure and tighten n if you change LINK_W, LINK_H,
    POST_R, or POST_H.

    The step also bounds how precisely a reported collision LOCATES its
    own boundary: the first interfering sample can be up to one step past
    the true onset, so a joint limit read off it must be set at least one
    step inside. The printed summary (sweep/report.py) says so.

    Same class of limit as `rebuild_sweep`'s (see part_template/README.md):
    this finds a collision that is there over a real grid; it does not
    prove one is absent between grid points narrower than the step.

    Cost is O(n^2) postures x n_pairs booleans: n=37 is ~1400 postures and
    took ~16 s for this 3-body example - fine for a planning-stage script
    run a handful of times, not something to put in a hot loop.
