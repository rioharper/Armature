# Model layout — how generated model code is laid out

Every Python module **armature-derive** writes under `analysis/model/` and **armature-cad**
writes under `cad/parts/` follows these rules. Skills point here; they don't restate them.
Firmware, ROS nodes, and bench procedures (**armature-test**, **armature-bringup**) are the
user's own code under the project's conventions, and sit outside them.

Every agent that opens a module pays for the whole file: the session editing it, the
red-team at a checkpoint, a later stage looking up one constant. The rules keep each read
to what its question needs.

## One section, one module, one checks module

A module mirrors the document it accompanies — a milestone note, a `docs/testing/` report,
a part definition — and its decomposition mirrors that document's sections. Outline the
document before writing code: the split is then a consequence of the outline, known before
any code exists, never a refactor forced at the checkpoint. A document with more than about
three substantive sections gets a package from the start:

```
dynamics/
  __init__.py            MILESTONE = (2, "Milestone 2: dynamics") — the identity, nothing else
  lagrangian.py          note §1–2
  lagrangian_checks.py
  statics.py             note §3
  statics_checks.py
```

The package's `__init__.py` owns the milestone identity: its `MILESTONE` tuple orders and
titles the run, and every submodule inherits it, running in file-name order. Other modules
import from the submodule that owns a name. A library package (a shared helper, not a
milestone) makes its `__init__.py` the public surface instead: the contract docstring and
the re-exported names callers import.

That triple — a document section, its submodule, its checks — is the red-team's review
unit: one coherent argument, held in view at a time.

## Checks one file over

A module's self-tests live in a sibling checks module named for it: `kinematics.py` →
`kinematics_checks.py`. Locality is kept — the checks sit beside what they check — and
neither file carries the other's lines. Discovery pairs the two by name, so moving a check
costs no registration; pytest never collects a `*_checks.py` directly, so the one pytest
bridge stays the only path and the two entry points cannot disagree. A checks module
orphaned by a rename, or paired with a report module, fails the layout check instead of
silently never running. A module named something `import` cannot spell — a part file,
`ARM-BRK-001.py` — is loaded by its checks module through `importlib` under the checks
module's own name, as the CAD template's `part_checks.py` shows.

## Reports print

Table formatting and long printed results live in a report module: `report_<scope>.py`
(`report_results.py`, `report_t11.py` for a plan task), or `report.py` inside a package.
Discovery never takes a report module for a milestone module, and a report module never
checks anything, so a renderer never inflates the file a red-team reads to check equations.

## The budget: 250 code lines

A **code line** is any line not blank, not comment-only, and not part of a docstring.
Documentation is free; the only way under the budget is to split. `layout.py` counts —
`ast` for docstrings, `tokenize` for comments — and ships inside each template, stdlib only,
because a copied project cannot import the plugin:

- `python layout.py` (in the template's directory) prints every module's count, and the
  line counts of the documents beside them — milestone notes, part definitions — for
  information, since documents carry no budget, then exits
  nonzero on a violation. It imports nothing but the standard library, so it runs where
  SymPy, SciPy, or build123d cannot.
- `run_all.py` — the same discovery runner in both templates — collects `layout.py`'s
  checks like any other, so the full run fails on a module over budget: in
  `analysis/model/` that run and `pytest` are the milestone checkpoint; in `cad/parts/`
  it is the one command that runs every part file's and library's self-tests. Running one
  name (`run_all.py kinematics`, `run_all.py check`) leaves the budget out: a file still
  being written is not red-barred mid-work.

A module that genuinely must stand large says why, at module level:

```python
LAYOUT_EXEMPT = "one generated lookup table; splitting it splits the table"
```

Anything but a non-empty string raises, so an exemption cannot be claimed without being
argued. The reason is surfaced in `layout.py`'s table, and the red-team challenges every
one: the fresh context judges the exception better than the session that just wrote the
file.

## Licence headers

A generated module that carries a licence carries one line —
`# SPDX-License-Identifier: <id>` — and the full text stays in the repository's licence
file. A header copied into every file multiplies by every split.
