# Changelog

## 1.3.0 — 2026-09-11

Lands the feedback log from running every stage on a demo project: each change below is a shape that project had to invent by hand, or a failure it hit. Charted and decided on the map [Land the armature-demo feedback log (1.3.0)](https://github.com/rioharper/armature/issues/26); each decision's ticket holds its reasoning. Ruled out along the way, with reasons on the map: Onshape live checks by API, an HTML rendering of briefs and reports, an electronics scaffold, and a quotable specification, RFQ, and quote register for custom parts.

### New references, templates, and scripts

- `references/model-layout.md` — one layout standard for generated analysis and CAD modules. A module's decomposition mirrors its note's sections (a package from the start once the note passes about three), self-tests sit one file over in a `<module>_checks.py`, tables print from `report_*.py`, and every module carries a hard **250-code-line budget**, counted by a stdlib-only `layout.py` that both templates ship and enforced by the full `run_all.py` and `pytest`. The one exception is `LAYOUT_EXEMPT = "<reason>"`, and the red team challenges it.
- `references/subagent-dispatch.md` — subagents go out **two or three at a time**, each wave landing before the next, because a subagent spends the dispatching session's context and share of the session limit whether it succeeds or dies. Name the cost first, size a run to one part or one slice, prefer the agent that writes as it goes. Every fan-out paragraph in spec, derive, plan, cad, and wayfind points here.
- `scripts/env-probe.sh` and `references/environment-record.md` — the probe prints `KEY=VALUE` and exits 0 whatever it finds, reporting the python invocation that works and telling a module that is `absent` from one that is `error: <Type>`. A spec's own tools arrive as arguments (`ros2 gazebo cuda`), with a `command -v` fallback for names the script does not know. Results land in the project's **environment record**, `docs/environment.md`: one dated section per machine, replaced by a re-probe and never hand-edited.
- `armature-plan`'s `references/derivation-report-template.md` — the report for an analysis task `armature-derive` runs, beside the bench test template: the decision as a heading, a write-back table for every number it moves, the assumptions under strain with the direction and size the model gives each, and a row per item routed to the task.
- The spec template's **§8 Software & Compute Architecture** — compute units with their runtime host; links with medium, protocol, a rate/latency/loss budget citing its REQ, and a seam-level verification (`unit`/`sim`/`bench`); data artifacts with schemas; relocation; and a ROS 2 graph only when there is a graph. Always answered, scaled to consequence.

### Changed

- `init` — the scaffolded `CLAUDE.md` opens with a `## Purpose` section (why *this builder* is building it, which the one-line description does not carry), and the builder profile asks once for **related work**. A core probe seeds `docs/environment.md`, and gaps are reported at hand-off. The datasheet index is seeded with `Clauses read` and `Price` cells; standing rules gain the reserve debit rule, a cost estimate citing the `Price` it read, and a CANDIDATE row carrying no decision.
- `armature-pitch` — the envelope question reads init's related-work line instead of re-asking and presses on the relationship: conceptual sibling, shared code, or this one supersedes it. The concept brief's §5 records it.
- `armature-spec` — gains §8 (above): §7's Interfaces column narrows to mechanical and electrical, and old §8–§11 become §9–§12. Phase 1 gains question 7, **Compute & software**. §6 gains a platform mapping (apex and ground range, stride and step height, turning radius, touchdown speed, attitude envelope) and `F` for a free body, and `design-foundations.md` reads its examples for mobile, legged, and aerial machines. The budgets template carries a **reserve** as a line item nothing debits directly, so a negative margin is a failed REQ; cost gains a `list price` rung citing the index row's `Price`, and a `quote only` part has no rung above `guess`.
- `armature-plan` — the leaf task is one session and one commit under a numbered parent, cut at every third-party wait; `Est:` is sessions plus wall-clock from a starting table, closed leaves carry `Actual:`, and each phase gate re-cuts from same-kind actuals. A **Before writing** step runs the environment probe on every invocation, the **machine split** (starting from spec §8.1; a role nobody has probed becomes Phase 0 work), and a satisfiability pass over every Must. §3 carries the table of all eight executors plus `armature-bringup + user`; the glossary's convention family follows the topology, floating base included. The header is rendered from the Revision History table on every save.
- `armature-derive` — self-tests are discovered by shape: `test_*` callables, ordered by each module's `MILESTONE = (order, title)`, run by `python run_all.py`, by `pytest` through `test_derivation.py`, or one milestone at a time with `python run_all.py <milestone>`; a discovery that finds nothing fails. `model_template` demonstrates the model layout (9 checks). Step 0 writes the measured-quantity reading of every requirement sized against into `00_setup.md`. `derivation-standards.md` gains the book-data rule (book, edition, and table; a second independent source; design to the conservative fit) and gives each sentence one layer, note or docstring. Milestone 3 owns the **corner sweep** and dispatches two red teams split by question. A plan's analysis task lands as a decision report.
- `armature-cad` — the part template adopts the model layout: `check/` and `sweep/` become packages (`from check import mass_properties` unchanged; `python -m sweep`), every `demo()` becomes a checks module, and `python cad/parts/run_all.py` runs all 29 self-tests and the budget. The release transition runs the corner sweep before it dispatches the red team. A project emitting `params.toml` is read there, `params.py` only for provenance.
- `armature-librarian` — gains Bash and writes as it goes: a named-part run ledgers into `docs/datasheets/staging/<task>-<subject>.md`, deleted at merge; a survey run writes the permanent `docs/datasheets/<task>-<subject>-<slice>.md`. Index rows gain **Clauses read** and **Price** (`quote only` where the vendor publishes none), and the `File` cell names the source kind. A long-lead part gets the **stand-in** question, answered either way. The librarian and `armature-inventor` descriptions carry the dispatch cap.
- `armature-red-team`'s checklist — probes for a breached reserve, a Must whose own clauses contradict each other, a routed item with no row, a report number no module prints, book data without its second source, an assumption without direction and size, a stale price (Minor at six months unre-read, Major when a cost margin closes on an old price, Blocker on a purchase), a §8 link with no budget or verification, and a layout exemption. Its inputs name each requirement's reading and the survey records.
- `armature-test` — seam agreement starts from the spec's §8.2 links.
- SolidWorks MCP server — connects per project (below). `sw.py` imports COM inside `attach()`, so a non-Windows host starts the server and reads a per-tool message instead of failing at import; a failed connection now means `uv` is not on PATH. Tools are `mcp__solidworks__sw_*`.
- `CONTEXT.md` gains Session, Leaf, Staging file, Survey file, Environment record, Corner sweep, Stand-in, Reserve, Link, Runtime host, Machine split, Milestone module, and Checks module; Executor points at `armature-plan`'s table.

### Removed

- The plugin-root `.mcp.json`: the SolidWorks server no longer starts in every session. `/armature:init` asks a SOLIDWORKS project whether to connect it and writes that project's `.mcp.json` on a yes, gitignored because it holds an absolute path into this machine's plugin install. Re-running init repoints a path a plugin update stranded.
### Upgrading a 1.2.x project

`/armature:init` stops on an existing project, so a project scaffolded under 1.2.x re-adopts by hand:

- `CLAUDE.md` — add the `## Purpose` section, the related-work bullet, and the new standing rules from `init`'s template.
- `docs/datasheets/index.md` — add the `Clauses read` and `Price` columns.
- `docs/environment.md` — written by the next `armature-plan` run, which probes on every invocation.
- `docs/01-spec/spec.md` — at its next revision, insert §8 and renumber §8–§11 to §9–§12, with every reference to them.
- `docs/01-spec/budgets.md` — carry each reserve as a line item.
- `analysis/model/` — copying in the new `run_all.py`, `layout.py`, and `test_derivation.py` turns the budget on, so an oversized module fails until it is split or declares `LAYOUT_EXEMPT`.
- A SOLIDWORKS project that relied on the bundled server has none after the update, and init's re-run will not add one: write `.mcp.json` in the shape `init`'s step 4 gives and add it to `.gitignore`.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-09-08

`init` hardening:

- The scaffolded `CLAUDE.md`'s Stage comment now maps each stage to the skill that works it (`concept (armature-pitch) → … → build (armature-bringup, armature-test)`), so a fresh session routes without the plugin README.
- A pre-existing non-Armature `CLAUDE.md` triggers a merge-or-replace question instead of being overwritten.
- The scaffold commit stages only the files init created or changed, keeping unrelated untracked files out in pre-existing repos.
- Standing rules annotate `docs/01-spec/budgets.md` as created by `armature-spec`; the CAD-package question mentions the bundled SolidWorks MCP server when the answer is SOLIDWORKS.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-30

Absorbs and adapts material from [Matt Pocock's skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT, see `NOTICE.md`) and brings every agent-facing doc to one writing standard.

### New skills

- `armature-wayfind` — multi-session efforts charted as a map of decision tickets on the project's issue tracker (GitHub Issues or local markdown, auto-detected), resolved one ticket per session by the stage skills and agents.
- `armature-test` — test-driven development for robot software, default-on in Armature projects: red → green at unit and simulation level, bench seams handed to `docs/testing/bench-seams.md`.
- `armature-debug` — user-invoked bench debugging: a red-capable feedback loop before any hypothesis, then one variable at a time. Ships `scripts/human-loop.template.sh`, the shared step/confirm/capture primitive.
- `armature-bringup` — a plan's bring-up or verification test as an executable bash procedure, measurements recorded into its `docs/testing/` report.

### Renames

- `armature-concept` → `armature-pitch`, `armature-math` → `armature-derive`, `armature-teacher` → `armature-teach`. Every skill name now reads as a verb; agents keep their noun personas. Artifact paths (`docs/00-concept/`, `analysis/`) are unchanged.

### Changed

- Pitch, spec, and plan interviews run in frontier rounds via `AskUserQuestion` (recommended answer first), checkpoint each round, and send lookups to `armature-librarian` mid-interview.
- Project glossaries move from `docs/02-plan/` to the user project's `CONTEXT.md`; `init`'s `CLAUDE.md` template carries the inline-challenge rule and a three-gate ADR tier over `docs/decisions.md`.
- `armature-spec` and `armature-cad` draft questionnaires (`references/questionnaire.template.md`) for unknowns a third party holds.
- `armature-derive` gains `references/phase-boundaries.md`, the five-option context-boundary tree.
- Every `SKILL.md`, agent, and reference rewritten to the writing standard: duplicated rules single-sourced, one trigger per description branch, checkable done-conditions, hand-offs as Skill-tool calls. Agent descriptions carry their dispatch contracts.
- Repo-level `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, and `docs/agents/domain.md` formalize the GitHub tracker and single-context domain docs.
- README gains a routing table and credits; `NOTICE.md` carries the MIT attribution.

## 1.1.0

- `armature-cad` executable build recipes (build123d): part definitions run as programs that check realized mass, COM, and inertia against `analysis/model/params.py`, self-validate features, render projected views, and sweep link envelopes for interference.
- SolidWorks MCP server (`mcp/solidworks/`): nine verification tools attached to a running session.

## 1.0.0

- First plugin release: `/armature:init`, the concept → spec → plan → math → CAD pipeline, the teacher skill, and the red-team, inventor, and librarian agents.
